Similar to Decorator pattern <br>
Purpose : Using operation in any combination you like i.e adapting a representation
of an object to another representation, so that we can use it in
a specific place.

Here the type of objects are different but in decorator pattern you have same type of objects/interfaces.

Eg. when using UserDetails in Spring security.
